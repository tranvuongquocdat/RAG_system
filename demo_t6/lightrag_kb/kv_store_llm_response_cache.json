    "return": "Dự án Tối ưu hóa Giá (Pricing Optimization) nhằm mục đích cải thiện hệ thống hiện tại của tổ chức để có được mức giá tốt hơn cho các tệp chưa được phát hành. Hệ thống hiện tại dựa trên việc đặt lại chỗ tự động và các cảnh báo cụ thể, nhưng có những hạn chế như chỉ phân tích từng tệp, thiếu cái nhìn tổng thể và không sử dụng dữ liệu lịch sử hoặc dữ liệu cạnh tranh.\n\nMục tiêu của dự án là hợp nhất dữ liệu từ nhật ký (logs) và đặt chỗ (bookings), xác định các khoảng thời gian tối ưu hóa tốt nhất, và tạo ra một báo cáo hoạt động có thể sử dụng được cho các nhóm.\n\nCác yêu cầu chính của dự án bao gồm:\n*   **Môi trường Phát triển:** Sử dụng Python và thiết lập môi trường phát triển cục bộ. Dữ liệu ban đầu được cung cấp dưới dạng tệp CSV, nhưng sau đó sẽ kết nối với API để lấy dữ liệu thực tế.\n*   **Kết hợp Dữ liệu:** Kết hợp các tệp `cdv_log_operation.csv` (nhật ký) và `cdv_wnj_air_booking_view.csv` (đặt chỗ) dựa trên khóa kết hợp `cdv_log_operation.lgop_element_id = cdv_wnj_air_booking_view.wbkg_reference`.\n*   **Lọc Bản ghi:** Giữ lại các hàng có `cdv_log_operation.lgop_status = 'S'`.\n*   **Trích xuất Dữ liệu:** Trích xuất các thông tin cần thiết cho việc tính toán như thời gian tối ưu hóa, hãng hàng không, điểm đi, điểm đến, ngày đi, và lợi nhuận.\n*   **Tổng hợp Phân tích:** Sắp xếp các bản ghi theo hãng hàng không và xác định các lợi nhuận tốt nhất dựa trên các điều kiện về điểm đi, điểm đến và ngày đi. Tạo tệp CSV `listeOptimisation_dd-MM-yyyy.csv` và điền dữ liệu dựa trên tệp Excel mẫu `Exemple rapport optimisation.xlsx`.\n*   **Phân tích Thời gian Chi tiết:** Tính toán lợi nhuận trung bình theo thời gian trong ngày, ngày trong tuần và kết hợp ngày + giờ. Xếp hạng 3 kết quả hàng đầu cho mỗi nhóm và lưu kết quả vào tệp JSON `topOptimisation.json`.\n*   **Phân phối Kết quả:** Gửi các tệp CSV và JSON lên không gian SFTP giữa 2 giờ sáng và 4 giờ sáng GMT+1.\n\nDự án được chia thành các giai đoạn phát triển:\n*   **Giai đoạn 0 - Khởi động Dự án:** Ngày 3-5 tháng 9 năm 2025.\n*   **Giai đoạn 1 - Phát triển:** Ngày 8-26 tháng 9 năm 2025.\n*   **Giai đoạn 2 - Kết nối API và Theo dõi Dự án:** Ngày 15 tháng 9 năm 2025 (API sẵn sàng), ngày 16 tháng 9 năm 2025 (họp với khách hàng).\n*   **Giai đoạn 3 - Phát triển Tính năng Nâng cao:** Ngày 17-19 tháng 9 năm 2025.\n*   **Giai đoạn 4 - Hoàn thiện:** Ngày 29 tháng 9 - 2 tháng 10 năm 2025 (bao gồm kiểm thử đơn vị và hiệu năng trên ~1 GB dữ liệu, và điều chỉnh dựa trên phản hồi của khách hàng).\n*   **Giai đoạn 5 - Giao hàng và Chấp nhận Cuối cùng:** Ngày 3 tháng 10 năm 2025 (đưa ứng dụng vào môi trường sản xuất của khách hàng và đạt được sự chấp nhận cuối cùng).\n\n[KG] Pricing Optimization\n[KG] The Organization\n[KG] Logs\n[KG] Bookings\n[KG] Python\n[KG] cdv_log_operation.csv\n[KG] cdv_wnj_air_booking_view.csv\n[KG] Status S\n[KG] Exemple rapport optimisation.xlsx\n[KG] listeOptimisation_dd-MM-yyyy.csv\n[KG] Average Gains\n[KG] topOptimisation.json\n[DC] Pricing Optimization.txt\n[DC] unknown_source",

(2007). We developed a simulation model\nbased on the BFS algorithm to quantitatively analyze gossip propagation within\nfriendship networks. Through extensive experiments on Barab´ asi-Albert, Erd˝ os-\nR´ enyi, and Apollonian networks, we discovered a counterintuitive phenomenon: an\noptimal number of connections (k0) that minimizes gossip spread risk. Our findings\nreveal that spreading time follows a universal logarithmic lawτ∼Blogk, with\nnetwork-dependent coefficients. These results have significant implications for un-\nderstanding information diffusion in social networks and developing strategies to\nmitigate harmful gossip in educational and online environments.\n1 Introduction\nGossip represents a unique form of social information exchange that profoundly impacts\nindividuals and communities. Recent studies indicate that 90% of workplace conversations\ninvolve gossip [2], while cyberbullying through online gossip affects 37% of teenagers\nglobally. Unlike general information diffusion, gossip exhibits distinctive characteristics:\nit targets specific individuals, spreads primarily through their social circles, and can cause\nlasting psychological harm.\nThe groundbreaking work by Lind et al. [1] introduced the first quantitative framework\nto analyze gossip dynamics in social networks. Their approach transcends traditional\nqualitative studies by providing measurable metrics for gossip propagation speed and\nreach. This quantification is crucial in the era of social media, where gossip can spread\nexponentially faster than in traditional settings.\nThis project aims to:\n•Replicate and validate the original gossip spread model through rigorous simulation\n•Investigate the universality of findings across diverse network topologies\n•Analyze model sensitivity to parameter variations and network characteristics\n•Propose practical applications for gossip mitigation in educational and digital envi-\nronments\n1\n\n\n--- File: 20242_TranVuongQuocDat_MathModeling_project.pdf | Page: 2 ---\n\n2 Modeling Methodology\n2.1 Rationale and Network Selection\nOur modeling approach employs graph theory to capture the complex dynamics of gossip\npropagation. This methodology offers several advantages:\n1.Mathematical Rigor: Graph representations enable precise quantification of so-\ncial relationships and information flow patterns.\n2.Gossip-Specific Constraints: The model captures the unique property that gos-\nsip about an individual spreads only among their acquaintances, distinguishing it\nfrom general rumor models.\n3.Computational Efficiency: Graph algorithms allow simulation of large-scale net-\nworks (N >104) with reasonable computational resources.\n4.Empirical Validation: The approach can be validated against real social network\ndata from schools and online platforms.\nWe selected three network types for comprehensive analysis:\nBarab´ asi-Albert (BA) Networks: These scale-free networks exhibit preferential\nattachment, mirroring real social networks where popular individuals attract more con-\nnections. The power-law degree distribution (P(k)∼k −γ) reflects the presence of social\n”hubs” - highly connected individuals who can either amplify or contain gossip spread.\nErd˝ os-R´ enyi Random Networks: Serving as a theoretical baseline, these networks\nhave binomial degree distributions and lack the hierarchical structure of real social net-\nworks. Their homogeneous nature helps isolate the effects of network topology on gossip\ndynamics.\nApollonian Networks: These deterministic networks possess unique properties in-\ncluding scale-free characteristics, small-world phenomena, and hierarchical organization.\nTheir recursive construction allows analytical derivation of spreading properties, providing\ntheoretical validation for simulation results.\n2.2 Mathematical Framework\n2.2.1 Network Representation and Dynamics\nWe model the social network as an undirected graphG= (V, E) with the following\nproperties:\n•Node setVrepresents individuals,|V|=N\n•Edge setErepresents bidirectional friendships\n•Degreek i =|{j: (i, j)∈E}|quantifies individuali’s social connectivity\n•Clustering coefficientC i = 2|{ejk :j,k∈N(i),ejk ∈E}|\nki(ki−1) measures local network density\n2\n\n\n--- File: 20242_TranVuongQuocDat_MathModeling_project.pdf | Page: 3 ---\n\n2.2.2 Gossip Propagation Rules\nThe gossip spreading process follows a constrained diffusion model:\n1.Initialization: Att= 0, originatoro∈N(v) possesses gossip about victimv\n2.Propagation: At each discrete time step, informed individuals transmit gossip to\nuninformed neighbors who satisfy:n∈N(v)∩N(i) andn /∈I(t), whereI(t) is the\nset of informed individuals at timet\n3.Termination: Process halts whenI(t+ 1) =I(t)\n2.2.3 Performance Metrics\nSpread Factor:\nf= nf + 1\nkv\n(1)\nThis normalized metric quantifies the fraction of the victim’s social circle ultimately ex-\nposed to gossip. The ”+1” accounts for the originator, ensuringf≥1/k v.\nSpreading Time:\nτ= max\ni∈I(∞)\ndG(o, i) (2)\nThis represents the geodesic distance to the furthest informed individual, capturing the\ntemporal extent of gossip propagation.\n3 Solution Algorithm\n3.1 Algorithm Selection and Justification\nWe employ Breadth-First Search (BFS) for gossip simulation due to its optimal properties:\n\n---Output---\nOutput:",

The\nemergence of minimum atk0 ≈30 represents an optimal social connectivity that minimizes\ngossip vulnerability.\nThe discovery of an optimal degreek 0 represents a counterintuitive finding with profound\nimplications. This phenomenon arises from competing effects:\n•Belowk 0: Limited connectivity creates isolated cliques where gossip saturates\nquickly within small groups.\n•Atk 0: Optimal balance between local clustering and global connectivity minimizes\noverall exposure.\n•Abovek 0: Extensive connections create multiple propagation paths, increasing\ngossip reach.\nThis finding suggests that moderately connected individuals (typically 25-35 friends\nin networks of 10,000) face the lowest gossip risk—a result applicable to social media\nconnection strategies.\n5\n\n\n--- File: 20242_TranVuongQuocDat_MathModeling_project.pdf | Page: 6 ---\n\n4.1.2 Universal Logarithmic Scaling\nFigure 2: Logarithmic relationship between spreading timeτand degreek.

dynamics. The power-law rela-\ntionshipB∼q −0.8 quantifies how skepticism and credibility affect spreading.\nIntroducing probabilistic transmission (q <1) models realistic scenarios where gossip isn’t\nalways believed or retransmitted:\nτ(q)∼ 1\nq0.8 logk(4)\nThis relationship implies:\n•Reducing transmission probability by 50% increases spreading time by∼74%\n•Even small increases in skepticism (q: 1→0.9) significantly slow gossip\n•The effect is stronger in heterogeneous networks due to multiple pathway interfer-\nence\n5 Conclusions and Future Directions\nThis study provides rigorous validation and extension of gossip spreading dynamics in\nsocial networks. Our key contributions include:\n1.Optimal Connectivity Discovery: The existence ofk 0 ≈30 for typical school-\nsized networks offers actionable guidance for social network design and anti-bullying\nstrategies.\n2.Universal Scaling Laws: The logarithmic relationship between spreading time\nand degree, consistent across network types, reveals fundamental constraints on\ninformation propagation.\n3.Network Structure Criticality: The dramatic differences between scale-free and\nrandom networks emphasize that gossip mitigation strategies must account for re-\nalistic social structures.\n4.Practical Parameter Ranges: Our sensitivity analysis provides concrete param-\neter ranges for applying the model to real-world scenarios.\n8\n\n\n--- File: 20242_TranVuongQuocDat_MathModeling_project.pdf | Page: 9 ---\n\n5.1 Immediate Applications\n•Educational Policy: Schools can use the optimal degree finding to structure class\nsizes and social groups that naturally minimize gossip spread\n•Social Media Design: Platforms could implement ”connection recommendations”\nthat guide users toward gossip-resistant network configurations\n•Cybersecurity: The model extends to malware propagation in computer networks\nsharing similar constraint\n5.2 Future Research Directions\n1.Dynamic Networks: Incorporate temporal evolution of friendships and their im-\npact on long-term gossip dynamics\n2.Weighted Edges: Model relationship strength to capture preferential gossip trans-\nmission between close friends\n3.Machine Learning Integration: Develop predictive models using graph neural\nnetworks trained on gossip spreading patterns\n4.Intervention Strategies: Design and test active intervention algorithms that iden-\ntify critical nodes for gossip suppression\n5.Cross-Cultural Validation: Examine how cultural factors affect model parame-\nters across different societies\nReferences\n[1] P.

study and replication of ”The spread of\\ngossip in American schools” by Lind et al. (2007). We developed a simulation model\\nbased on the BFS algorithm to quantitatively analyze gossip propagation within\\nfriendship networks. Through extensive experiments on Barab´ asi-Albert, Erd˝ os-\\nR´ enyi, and Apollonian networks, we discovered a counterintuitive phenomenon: an\\noptimal number of connections (k0) that minimizes gossip spread risk. Our findings\\nreveal that spreading time follows a universal logarithmic lawτ∼Blogk, with\\nnetwork-dependent coefficients. These results have significant implications for un-\\nderstanding information diffusion in social networks and developing strategies to\\nmitigate harmful gossip in educational and online environments.\\n1 Introduction\\nGossip represents a unique form of social information exchange that profoundly impacts\\nindividuals and communities. Recent studies indicate that 90% of workplace conversations\\ninvolve gossip [2], while cyberbullying through online gossip affects 37% of teenagers\\nglobally. Unlike general information diffusion, gossip exhibits distinctive characteristics:\\nit targets specific individuals, spreads primarily through their social circles, and can cause\\nlasting psychological harm.\\nThe groundbreaking work by Lind et al. [1] introduced the first quantitative framework\\nto analyze gossip dynamics in social networks. Their approach transcends traditional\\nqualitative studies by providing measurable metrics for gossip propagation speed and\\nreach. This quantification is crucial in the era of social media, where gossip can spread\\nexponentially faster than in traditional settings.\\nThis project aims to:\\n•Replicate and validate the original gossip spread model through rigorous simulation\\n•Investigate the universality of findings across diverse network topologies\\n•Analyze model sensitivity to parameter variations and network characteristics\\n•Propose practical applications for gossip mitigation in educational and digital envi-\\nronments\\n1\\n\\n\\n--- File: 20242_TranVuongQuocDat_MathModeling_project.pdf | Page: 2 ---\\n\\n2 Modeling Methodology\\n2.1 Rationale and Network Selection\\nOur modeling approach employs graph theory to capture the complex dynamics of gossip\\npropagation. This methodology offers several advantages:\\n1.Mathematical Rigor: Graph representations enable precise quantification of so-\\ncial relationships and information flow patterns.\\n2.Gossip-Specific Constraints: The model captures the unique property that gos-\\nsip about an individual spreads only among their acquaintances, distinguishing it\\nfrom general rumor models.\\n3.Computational Efficiency: Graph algorithms allow simulation of large-scale net-\\nworks (N >104) with reasonable computational resources.\\n4.Empirical Validation: The approach can be validated against real social network\\ndata from schools and online platforms.\\nWe selected three network types for comprehensive analysis:\\nBarab´ asi-Albert (BA) Networks: These scale-free networks exhibit preferential\\nattachment, mirroring real social networks where popular individuals attract more con-\\nnections. The power-law degree distribution (P(k)∼k −γ) reflects the presence of social\\n”hubs” - highly connected individuals who can either amplify or contain gossip spread.\\nErd˝ os-R´ enyi Random Networks: Serving as a theoretical baseline, these networks\\nhave binomial degree distributions and lack the hierarchical structure of real social net-\\nworks. Their homogeneous nature helps isolate the effects of network topology on gossip\\ndynamics.\\nApollonian Networks: These deterministic networks possess unique properties in-\\ncluding scale-free characteristics, small-world phenomena, and hierarchical organization.\\nTheir recursive construction allows analytical derivation of spreading properties, providing\\ntheoretical validation for simulation results.\\n2.2 Mathematical Framework\\n2.2.1 Network Representation and Dynamics\\nWe model the social network as an undirected graphG= (V, E) with the following\\nproperties:\\n•Node setVrepresents individuals,|V|=N\\n•Edge setErepresents bidirectional friendships\\n•Degreek i =|{j: (i, j)∈E}|quantifies individuali’s social connectivity\\n•Clustering coefficientC i = 2|{ejk :j,k∈N(i),ejk ∈E}|\\nki(ki−1) measures local network density\\n2\\n\\n\\n--- File: 20242_TranVuongQuocDat_MathModeling_project.pdf | Page: 3 ---\\n\\n2.2.2 Gossip Propagation Rules\\nThe gossip spreading process follows a constrained diffusion model:\\n1.Initialization: Att= 0, originatoro∈N(v) possesses gossip about victimv\\n2.Propagation: At each discrete time step, informed individuals transmit gossip to\\nuninformed neighbors who satisfy:n∈N(v)∩N(i) andn /∈I(t), whereI(t) is the\\nset of informed individuals at timet\\n3.Termination: Process halts whenI(t+ 1) =I(t)\\n2.2.3 Performance Metrics\\nSpread Factor:\\nf= nf + 1\\nkv\\n(1)\\nThis normalized metric quantifies the fraction of the victim’s social circle ultimately ex-\\nposed to gossip. The ”+1” accounts for the originator, ensuringf≥1/k v.\\nSpreading Time:\\nτ= max\\ni∈I(∞)\\ndG(o, i) (2)\\nThis represents the geodesic distance to the furthest informed individual, capturing the\\ntemporal extent of gossip propagation.\\n3 Solution Algorithm\\n3.1 Algorithm Selection and Justification\\nWe employ Breadth-First Search (BFS) for gossip simulation due to its optimal

The existing system relies on automatic rebookings and specific alerts, analyzing files individually. This approach is limited because it lacks a global view and does not utilize historical or competitive data, necessitating a more structured process.\n\nThe primary objective of the pricing optimization project is to consolidate data from logs and bookings, identify optimal time windows for pricing adjustments, and generate an operational report for team use. Currently, the system detects price drop opportunities as they occur without prioritization or grouping, leading to inefficiencies. The project aims to develop an automated workflow to address these limitations.\n\nThis automated workflow will be responsible for joining and structuring raw data, isolating relevant optimizations, analyzing gains and itineraries, and identifying the best opportunities based on day and route through aggregation. The results will be returned in a usable format and distributed automatically. The project requires the use of Python as the primary technology.\n\nReferences:\n[KG] Pricing Optimization\n[KG] Pricing Optimization Project\n[KG] Structured Process\n[KG] Organization\n[KG] Pricing Optimization System",

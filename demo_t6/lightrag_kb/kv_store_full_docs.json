(2007). We developed a simulation model\nbased on the BFS algorithm to quantitatively analyze gossip propagation within\nfriendship networks. Through extensive experiments on Barab´ asi-Albert, Erd˝ os-\nR´ enyi, and Apollonian networks, we discovered a counterintuitive phenomenon: an\noptimal number of connections (k0) that minimizes gossip spread risk. Our findings\nreveal that spreading time follows a universal logarithmic lawτ∼Blogk, with\nnetwork-dependent coefficients. These results have significant implications for un-\nderstanding information diffusion in social networks and developing strategies to\nmitigate harmful gossip in educational and online environments.\n1 Introduction\nGossip represents a unique form of social information exchange that profoundly impacts\nindividuals and communities. Recent studies indicate that 90% of workplace conversations\ninvolve gossip [2], while cyberbullying through online gossip affects 37% of teenagers\nglobally. Unlike general information diffusion, gossip exhibits distinctive characteristics:\nit targets specific individuals, spreads primarily through their social circles, and can cause\nlasting psychological harm.\nThe groundbreaking work by Lind et al. [1] introduced the first quantitative framework\nto analyze gossip dynamics in social networks. Their approach transcends traditional\nqualitative studies by providing measurable metrics for gossip propagation speed and\nreach. This quantification is crucial in the era of social media, where gossip can spread\nexponentially faster than in traditional settings.\nThis project aims to:\n•Replicate and validate the original gossip spread model through rigorous simulation\n•Investigate the universality of findings across diverse network topologies\n•Analyze model sensitivity to parameter variations and network characteristics\n•Propose practical applications for gossip mitigation in educational and digital envi-\nronments\n1\n\n\n--- File: 20242_TranVuongQuocDat_MathModeling_project.pdf | Page: 2 ---\n\n2 Modeling Methodology\n2.1 Rationale and Network Selection\nOur modeling approach employs graph theory to capture the complex dynamics of gossip\npropagation. This methodology offers several advantages:\n1.Mathematical Rigor: Graph representations enable precise quantification of so-\ncial relationships and information flow patterns.\n2.Gossip-Specific Constraints: The model captures the unique property that gos-\nsip about an individual spreads only among their acquaintances, distinguishing it\nfrom general rumor models.\n3.Computational Efficiency: Graph algorithms allow simulation of large-scale net-\nworks (N >104) with reasonable computational resources.\n4.Empirical Validation: The approach can be validated against real social network\ndata from schools and online platforms.\nWe selected three network types for comprehensive analysis:\nBarab´ asi-Albert (BA) Networks: These scale-free networks exhibit preferential\nattachment, mirroring real social networks where popular individuals attract more con-\nnections. The power-law degree distribution (P(k)∼k −γ) reflects the presence of social\n”hubs” - highly connected individuals who can either amplify or contain gossip spread.\nErd˝ os-R´ enyi Random Networks: Serving as a theoretical baseline, these networks\nhave binomial degree distributions and lack the hierarchical structure of real social net-\nworks. Their homogeneous nature helps isolate the effects of network topology on gossip\ndynamics.\nApollonian Networks: These deterministic networks possess unique properties in-\ncluding scale-free characteristics, small-world phenomena, and hierarchical organization.\nTheir recursive construction allows analytical derivation of spreading properties, providing\ntheoretical validation for simulation results.\n2.2 Mathematical Framework\n2.2.1 Network Representation and Dynamics\nWe model the social network as an undirected graphG= (V, E) with the following\nproperties:\n•Node setVrepresents individuals,|V|=N\n•Edge setErepresents bidirectional friendships\n•Degreek i =|{j: (i, j)∈E}|quantifies individuali’s social connectivity\n•Clustering coefficientC i = 2|{ejk :j,k∈N(i),ejk ∈E}|\nki(ki−1) measures local network density\n2\n\n\n--- File: 20242_TranVuongQuocDat_MathModeling_project.pdf | Page: 3 ---\n\n2.2.2 Gossip Propagation Rules\nThe gossip spreading process follows a constrained diffusion model:\n1.Initialization: Att= 0, originatoro∈N(v) possesses gossip about victimv\n2.Propagation: At each discrete time step, informed individuals transmit gossip to\nuninformed neighbors who satisfy:n∈N(v)∩N(i) andn /∈I(t), whereI(t) is the\nset of informed individuals at timet\n3.Termination: Process halts whenI(t+ 1) =I(t)\n2.2.3 Performance Metrics\nSpread Factor:\nf= nf + 1\nkv\n(1)\nThis normalized metric quantifies the fraction of the victim’s social circle ultimately ex-\nposed to gossip. The ”+1” accounts for the originator, ensuringf≥1/k v.\nSpreading Time:\nτ= max\ni∈I(∞)\ndG(o, i) (2)\nThis represents the geodesic distance to the furthest informed individual, capturing the\ntemporal extent of gossip propagation.\n3 Solution Algorithm\n3.1 Algorithm Selection and Justification\nWe employ Breadth-First Search (BFS) for gossip simulation due to its optimal properties:\n•Temporal Accuracy: BFS naturally models simultaneous information transmis-\nsion at each time step, reflecting realistic gossip dynamics where multiple individuals\ncan spread information concurrently.\n•Optimal Path Guarantee: BFS computes exact shortest paths, ensuring accurate\nspreading time calculations.\n•Computational Efficiency: Time complexityO(|V|+|E|) enables large-scale\nsimulations.\n•Memory Efficiency: Space complexityO(|V|) allows processing of networks with\nmillions of nodes.\nAlternative algorithms like DFS would incorrectly model sequential rather than par-\nallel spreading, while Dijkstra’s algorithm offers no advantage for unweighted graphs.\n3\n\n\n--- File: 20242_TranVuongQuocDat_MathModeling_project.pdf | Page: 4 ---\n\n3.2 Implementation Details\nAlgorithm 1Optimized Gossip Propagation with BFS\nRequire:GraphG, victimv, originatoro\nEnsure:Spread factorf, spreading timeτ\n1:ifo /∈N(v)then\n2:return0,0{Invalid originator}\n3:end if\n4:visited← {o} {Bitset forO(1) operations}\n5:queue←deque[(o,0)]{Double-ended queue}\n6:τ←0\n7:V eligible ←N(v)∩ S\nu∈N(v) N(u){Pre-compute eligible nodes}\n8:whilequeue̸=∅do\n9:(current, time)←queue.popleft()\n10:τ←max(τ, time)\n11:forneighbor∈N(current)∩V eligible do\n12:ifneighbor /∈visitedthen\n13:visited.add(neighbor)\n14:queue.append((neighbor, time+ 1))\n15:end if\n16:end for\n17:end while\n18:f← |visited|/k v\n19:returnf, τ\n4\n\n\n--- File: 20242_TranVuongQuocDat_MathModeling_project.pdf | Page: 5 ---\n\n4 Results and Discussion\n4.1 Critical Findings and Their Implications\n4.1.1 Optimal Degree Phenomenon\nFigure 1: Spread factorfversus degreekfor BA network (m= 7,N= 10 4). The\nemergence of minimum atk0 ≈30 represents an optimal social connectivity that minimizes\ngossip vulnerability.\nThe discovery of an optimal degreek 0 represents a counterintuitive finding with profound\nimplications. This phenomenon arises from competing effects:\n•Belowk 0: Limited connectivity creates isolated cliques where gossip saturates\nquickly within small groups.\n•Atk 0: Optimal balance between local clustering and global connectivity minimizes\noverall exposure.\n•Abovek 0: Extensive connections create multiple propagation paths, increasing\ngossip reach.\nThis finding suggests that moderately connected individuals (typically 25-35 friends\nin networks of 10,000) face the lowest gossip risk—a result applicable to social media\nconnection strategies.\n5\n\n\n--- File: 20242_TranVuongQuocDat_MathModeling_project.pdf | Page: 6 ---\n\n4.1.2 Universal Logarithmic Scaling\nFigure 2: Logarithmic relationship between spreading timeτand degreek. The universal\nscalingτ=A+Blogkholds across network types with network-specific coefficients.\nThe logarithmic scaling law emerges from fundamental network properties:\nτ=A+Blogk(3)\nWith fitted parameters:\n•BA networks:B= 2.285±0.015 (higher due to heterogeneous structure)\n•APL networks:B= 1.284±0.008 (lower due to deterministic hierarchy)\nThis universal behavior suggests that doubling one’s connections only marginally in-\ncreases gossip spreading time, emphasizing the importance of network structure over raw\nconnectivity.\n6\n\n\n--- File: 20242_TranVuongQuocDat_MathModeling_project.pdf | Page: 7 ---\n\n4.1.3 Network Topology Effects\nFigure 3: Comparison of gossip dynamics in random networks. The absence of optimal\ndegree highlights the crucial role of heterogeneous structure in real social networks.\nRandom networks exhibit fundamentally different behavior:\n•No optimal degree exists due to homogeneous structure\n•Spreading time shows weaker dependence on degree (B <1)\n•Higher overall spread factors indicate less effective gossip containment\nThese differences underscore why strategies effective in random networks may fail in\nreal social environments with power-law degree distributions.\n4.2 Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis\n4.2.1 Scale Dependence and Finite-Size Effects\nNetwork SizeN k 0 (BA)B(BA)⟨C⟩k 0/⟨k⟩CPU Time (s)\n1,000 15±2 2.15±0.03 0.082 1.07 0.3\n5,000 22±2 2.24±0.02 0.051 1.57 8.7\n10,000 28±3 2.285±0.015 0.039 2.00 42.1\n50,000 41±4 2.31±0.01 0.024 2.93 1,205\nTable 1: Scaling behavior of key parameters with network size, revealingk0 ∼N 0.4 scaling.\nThe analysis reveals:\n•Optimal degree scaling:k 0 ∝N α withα≈0.4, suggesting larger communities\nrequire proportionally more connections for gossip resistance\n•Coefficient stability:Bconverges forN >5000, indicating robust universal\nbehavior\n•Clustering decay: Decreasing clustering coefficient explains increasingk 0/⟨k⟩ra-\ntio\n7\n\n\n--- File: 20242_TranVuongQuocDat_MathModeling_project.pdf | Page: 8 ---\n\n4.2.2 Transmission Probability Effects\nFigure 4: Impact of transmission probabilityqon gossip dynamics. The power-law rela-\ntionshipB∼q −0.8 quantifies how skepticism and credibility affect spreading.\nIntroducing probabilistic transmission (q <1) models realistic scenarios where gossip isn’t\nalways believed or retransmitted:\nτ(q)∼ 1\nq0.8 logk(4)\nThis relationship implies:\n•Reducing transmission probability by 50% increases spreading time by∼74%\n•Even small increases in skepticism (q: 1→0.9) significantly slow gossip\n•The effect is stronger in heterogeneous networks due to multiple pathway interfer-\nence\n5 Conclusions and Future Directions\nThis study provides rigorous validation and extension of gossip spreading dynamics in\nsocial networks. Our key contributions include:\n1.Optimal Connectivity Discovery: The existence ofk 0 ≈30 for typical school-\nsized networks offers actionable guidance for social network design and anti-bullying\nstrategies.\n2.Universal Scaling Laws: The logarithmic relationship between spreading time\nand degree, consistent across network types, reveals fundamental constraints on\ninformation propagation.\n3.Network Structure Criticality: The dramatic differences between scale-free and\nrandom networks emphasize that gossip mitigation strategies must account for re-\nalistic social structures.\n4.Practical Parameter Ranges: Our sensitivity analysis provides concrete param-\neter ranges for applying the model to real-world scenarios.\n8\n\n\n--- File: 20242_TranVuongQuocDat_MathModeling_project.pdf | Page: 9 ---\n\n5.1 Immediate Applications\n•Educational Policy: Schools can use the optimal degree finding to structure class\nsizes and social groups that naturally minimize gossip spread\n•Social Media Design: Platforms could implement ”connection recommendations”\nthat guide users toward gossip-resistant network configurations\n•Cybersecurity: The model extends to malware propagation in computer networks\nsharing similar constraint\n5.2 Future Research Directions\n1.Dynamic Networks: Incorporate temporal evolution of friendships and their im-\npact on long-term gossip dynamics\n2.Weighted Edges: Model relationship strength to capture preferential gossip trans-\nmission between close friends\n3.Machine Learning Integration: Develop predictive models using graph neural\nnetworks trained on gossip spreading patterns\n4.Intervention Strategies: Design and test active intervention algorithms that iden-\ntify critical nodes for gossip suppression\n5.Cross-Cultural Validation: Examine how cultural factors affect model parame-\nters across different societies\nReferences\n[1] P.

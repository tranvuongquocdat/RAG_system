Data  Joining  \n●  Files:  cdv_log_operation.csv (logs)  and  cdv_wnj_air_booking_view.csv \n(bookings).\n ●  Join  Key:  cdv_log_operation.lgop_element_id =  cdv_wnj_air_booking_view.wbkg_reference.  \n●  Action:  Join  the  two  tables  to  extract  the  necessary  data  for  calculating  the  optimization  \ndatetimes.\n \n3.  Record  Filtering  \n●  Action:  Keep  only  the  rows  where  cdv_log_operation.lgop_status =  'S'.  \n4.  Data  Extraction  for  Calculations  \n●  Optimization  Datetime:  cdv_log_operation.lgop_when.  ●  Airline:  cdv_wnj_air_booking_view.dair_code.  ●  Start  of  Trip:  cdv_wnj_air_booking_view.FromAirportCode.  ●  End  of  Trip:  cdv_wnj_air_booking_view.ToAirportCode.  ●  Travel  Dates:  cdv_wnj_air_booking_view.wbkg_start_date.  ●  Gain:  From  cdv_log_operation.lgop_results.  \n \n5.  Analytical  Aggregation  of  the  Optimization  List  \n●  Sort  records  by  airline:   cdv_wnj_air_booking_view.dair_code.  ●  For  each  airline  (cdv_wnj_air_booking_view.dair_code),  keep  the  records  with  \nthe\n \nbest\n \ngains\n \n(cdv_log_operation.lgop_results)  when  the  Start  of  trip,  End  of  \ntrip,\n \nand\n \nTravel\n \ndates\n \nare\n \nidentical.\n ●  For  each  airline,  if  one  of  the  conditions  (Start  of  trip,  End  of  trip,  or  Travel  dates)  is  not  \nidentical,\n \nkeep\n \nthe\n \nrow.\n ●  Generate  the  CSV  file  named  \n listeOptimisation_dd-MM-yyyy.csv,  where  dd-MM-yyyy is  the  date  the  file  is  \ngenerated.\n ●  Refer  to  the  example  Excel  file  (Exemple  rapport  optimisation.xlsx)  and  fill  in  \nall\n \nthe\n \nrequired\n \ndata\n \nbased\n \non\n \nits\n \ncorrespondence.\n \n6.  Nuanced  Time  Analysis  \n●  For  each  airline,  after  extracting  the  best  gains,  the  goal  is  to  find  average  trends.  ●  Calculate  the  average  gains  by:  ○  Time  of  day  (e.g.,  gains  are,  on  average,  better  around  3  a.m.).  ○  Day  of  the  week  (e.g.,  Tuesday  is  more  favorable  than  Friday).  ○  Combined  day  +  hour  (e.g.,  Monday  at  10  a.m.  gives  the  best  average  results).  ●  From  the  \n cdv_log_operation.lgop_when column  (optimization  datetime),  extract  the  hour  of  \nthe\n \nday\n \n(an\n \ninteger\n \nfrom\n \n0\n \nto\n \n23)\n \nand\n \nthe\n \nday\n \nof\n \nthe\n \nweek.\n ●  Average  by  Time  of  Day:  Group  all  rows  by  hour  (regardless  of  the  day)  and  calculate  \nthe\n \naverage\n \ngain\n \nfor\n \neach\n \nhour.\n \n●  Average  by  Day  of  the  Week:  Group  all  rows  by  the  day  of  the  week  and  calculate  the  \naverage\n \ngain\n \nfor\n \neach\n \nday.\n ●  Combined  Average  (Day  +  Hour):  Create  a  combination  of  day  +  hour  (e.g.,  Monday  at  \n10\n \na.m.,\n \nMonday\n \nat\n \n11\n \na.m.,\n \nTuesday\n \nat\n \n9\n \na.m.,\n \netc.,\n \nwhich\n \nis\n \n7×24\n \ncombinations).\n \nCalculate\n \nthe\n \naverage\n \ngain\n \nfor\n \neach\n \ncombination.\n ●  Ranking  Slots:  For  each  grouping  (hour  only,  day  only,  day  +  hour),  sort  the  results  by  \naverage\n \ngain\n \nin\n \ndescending\n \norder.\n \nKeep\n \nthe\n \n \nTOP\n \n3\n \nfor\n \neach\n \ngrouping.\n ●  JSON  Output:  Save  the  results  in  a  file  named  topOptimisation.json.  The  file  \nformat\n \nis\n \nspecified\n \nin\n \nthe\n \ndocument\n \n.\n \n7.  Results  Distribution  \n●  Deposit  the  CSV  and  JSON  files  on  an  SFTP  space  (coordinates  to  be  specified).  ●  The  files  must  be  deposited  between  2  a.m.  and  4  a.m.  GMT+1.  \nData  Provision  \nTo  facilitate  development,  the  client  is  providing  two  databases  in  .CSV  format,  which  represent  \n20-30%\n \nof\n \nthe\n \ntotal\n \ndata\n \nvolume\n \nto\n \nbe\n \nprocessed:\n \n●  cdv_log_operation.csv  ●  cdv_wnj_air_booking_view.csv  \nTheir  architecture  files  are  also  provided:  \n●  cdv_log_operation.md  ●  cdv_wnj_air_booking_view.md  \nThe  Excel  file  for  building  the  CSV  report  is  also  included  (Exemple  rapport  \noptimisation.xlsx).  The  data  order  must  be  respected  as  transmitted  in  the  file.  \nAdditional  Information  \n●  The  required  technology  for  this  project  is  Python .  \n \nDevelopment  Timeline  (Adjusted)  \n●  Phase  0  -  Project  Launch:  September  3-5,  2025  ○  Retrieve  and  validate  example  files  (CSV  extracts).  ○  Set  up  the  local  development  environment.  ○  Verify  data  schemas  and  formats.  ●  Phase  1  -  Development:  September  8-26,  2025  \n○  Develop  the  application.  ●  Phase  2  -  API  Connection  and  Project  Follow-up:  ○  September  15,  2025:  API  for  real  data  retrieval  becomes  available.  ○  September  16,  2025:  Project  meeting  with  the  client  to  validate  the  API  \nconnection\n \nand\n \nprogress.\n ●  Phase  3  -  Advanced  Feature  Development:  September  17-19,  2025  ○  Adapt  the  pipeline  for  ingestion  via  the  API  (instead  of  CSVs).  ○  Verify  schema  compatibility  between  CSV  and  API.  ●  Phase  4  -  Finalization:  September  29  -  October  2,  2025  ○  Run  unit  and  performance  tests  on  ~1  GB  of  data.  ○  Make  adjustments  based  on  client  feedback.  ●  Phase  5  -  Delivery  and  Final  Acceptance:  October  3,  2025  ○  Put  the  application  into  production  on  the  client's  environment  (server  \nconfiguration\n \nhandled\n \nby\n \nthe\n \nclient).\n ○  Final  acceptance.  \nKey  Milestones:  \n●  September  3:  Start  of  development  with  example  files.  ●  September  15:  API  becomes  available.  ●  September  16:  Follow-up  meeting.  ●  October  3:  Production  delivery.",
